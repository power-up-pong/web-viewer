**Note:** The bulk of the work has been done in `src/components/pong`. The rest of the files were bootstrapped using the Preact CLI and have been modified for this project.

## CLI Commands

- `npm install`: Installs dependencies

- `npm run dev`: Run a development, HMR server

- `npm run serve`: Run a production-like server

Note: need to build before serving.

- `npm run build`: Production-ready build

- `npm run lint`: Pass TypeScript files using ESLint

- `npm run test`: Run Jest and Enzyme with
  [`enzyme-adapter-preact-pure`](https://github.com/preactjs/enzyme-adapter-preact-pure) for
  your tests
